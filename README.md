Meteor.js Public API
=========

**Using Meteor, create:**

    - server collection that listens to a public external API of your choice via http calls and saves updates.
    - using "cursor observe" and publish methods, observe changes from the collection and publish them to a client-only collection
    - display last 20 updates on the client
    - have "start / stop" button on the client that starts / stops client functionality. Server collection listening to an external API needs to run always.
